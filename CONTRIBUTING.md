# Contributing Guidelines  

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process.   
We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to improve/add new projects (doesn't matter which language) to this Repository.

### Before contributing please ensure your **pull request** adheres to the following guidelines:


 ## STEP-0 : Key Points to remember :
  - Look at the previous projects and get some idea from them [Previous](https://github.com/Kushal997-das/Project-Guidance)
  - Suppose you want to contribute one javascript projet then first check is there any [javascript folder](https://github.com/Kushal997-das/Project-Guidance) is existing or not.
  - If Yes then you can contribute there but make sure under that folder you have to create another folder with your project name . 
  - If there is no such folder then make sure you create one folder and folder name should be **Javascript**  (In this case)  and add your project.
  
    -  **NOTE** If you think the project which you want to contribute is beginner level then the flow should be like this :-
        - **Javascript --> Basic --> Projects_name(folder) --> project_file** (In case of Basic Project)
        - **Javascript --> Intermediate --> Projects_name(folder) --> project_file** (in case of intermediate)
        - **Javascript --> Advance --> Projects_name(folder) --> project_file** (In case of Advance Project)
 
## STEP-1 : Find an issue
  - Take a look at the Existing [Issues](https://github.com/Kushal997-das/Project-Guidance/issues) or create your own [Issues!](https://github.com/Kushal997-das/Project-Guidance/issues)
  - Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
